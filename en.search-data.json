The main power supply is generally the city power, which comes from a transformer; the backup power supply is usually supplied from a diesel generator. When working, a controller is used to realize the conversion of the main supply and the backup supply: when the main supply is powered, the controller automatically closes the main supply circuit, that is, the power is supplied by the transformer; when the main supply fails, the controller will give the generator set a The start signal allows the engine to work and supply power. At this time, the backup supply circuit will be charged, and the dual power supply will automatically separate the main supply and close the backup supply. When the main power supply is restored, the standby power supply will be separated, the main power supply will be closed, and the controller will send a signal to the generator set to stop it. In fact, this is what we usually call the “self-input and self-recovery” function of dual power supplies.\nPerformance characteristics： Comprehensive protection functions: reverse power protection, overcurrent protection (completed by circuit breaker), generator set fault opening protection, overload protection (independent of switch), voltage fault protection, emergency stop function. There are other protection functions for customers to choose to configure. The dual-power automatic transfer switch is composed of a device and an automatic controller. The automatic controller is divided into three types: automatic switching and automatic recovery, automatic switching without automatic recovery, and power grid-generator. They are connected to the device to form automatic switching of different control methods and functions. switch. It is suitable for dual power supply systems with AC 50Hz and rated working voltage up to 400V and below. The switch has double protection of electrical interlock and mechanical interlock, and at the same time has the functions of overvoltage and undervoltage in any phase of the three-phase power supply, including overcurrent protection and short circuit protection in the circuit. Widely used in high-rise buildings, hospitals, shopping malls, banks, chemical industry, military facilities and other important power supply places. ATS transfer switch cabinet is used for the conversion of two mains.\nThe ATS transfer switch cabinet monitors the power supply quality of the two mains in real time (at this time, the controller can be set to three working modes: one main, two main, and no main). Self-recovery), when the main line is powered off or the quality of power supply cannot meet the load requirements, the control system will automatically transfer the load to the backup power supply. When the main line returns to normal, the control system automatically transfers the load to the main line for power supply. When there is no active use (that is, self-injection and no self-recovery), when the first mains power is cut off or the quality of power supply cannot meet the load requirements, the control system will automatically transfer the load to the second mains power supply. Only when the second mains power failure or power supply When the quality cannot meet the load requirements, the control system will transfer the load to a commercial power supply.\nWe welcome global agents, distributors, retailers, and other partners to join us and work together to develop mutually beneficial business relationships.

Small and classic, with perfect motor comprehensive protection function! This product is widely used in the starting control of transmission equipment, fans, pumps, crushers and other loads. The product complies with GB14048.6-2016\nPerformance characteristics： The soft starter design concept adheres to the principle of reliability, ease of use, practicality and low overall cost. The comprehensive cost mentioned here includes: manufacturing cost, on-site commissioning cost, fault diagnosis cost, after-sales service cost, etc. The specific features are listed below\nThe screen displays a large amount of information, which is convenient for remote diagnosis and analysis, and reduces the cost of fault resolution caused by miscalculation, including round-trip travel expenses\nExternally adapted N/5 current transformers, compared to N/1 or N/0.1 transformers, market versatility, convenient after-sales maintenance.\nThe thyristor driver circuit adopts pulse transformer to reduce the damage of the circuit board caused by poor conduction of thyristors.\nThere is no need to calibrate the current in the field. The V3 soft starter abandons the previous method of adapting the current sampling resistance to different power starter cabinets. The biggest disadvantage of the original method is that when matching different power cabinets, the current sensing resistance needs to be changed, and it often needs to be calibrated in the field. The V3 soft starter can be matched to the respective power cabinet only by means of a transformer ratio setting. Because of its versatility, it is greatly convenient for the whole machine factory stocking and on-site after-sales service personnel.\nThe trigger circuit is powerful and can be used with thyristors with trigger currents up to 100mA. Expand the adaptation range of thyristors, and also facilitate the selection of the whole machine factory.\nAll relays can be programmed for flexible response to user requirements.\nSet the starting and stopping methods of panel buttons and terminal blocks (jogging, soft starting, soft stop combinations) respectively, which can cope with some special requirements.\nA true two-wire approach. Two-wire control, start-stop mode wiring is extremely simple. In general, this start-stop method is especially suitable for float water supply applications.\nTwo starting methods: voltage start, current limit start.Voltage starting mode, similar to autocoupling starting or star-delta starting. However, it is especially suitable for occasions where the on-site power supply is relatively “soft”: the starting voltage output to the motor at starting is not affected by the input voltage, but only depends on the set starting voltage (except for the power supply voltage \u003c the starting voltage). It can reduce the unnecessary “slope climbing” time, reduce the high current heating time when the motor is started, and facilitate the rapid completion of the starting process;The current-limiting starting method is suitable for occasions where the starting current is relatively small on site. The average current of the three phases during the whole process of starting does not exceed the set value.\nTriac current limiting function. During the entire starting, running and soft-stop process, the current is monitored at any time not exceeding the nominal current of the thyristor. Minimize thyristor damage due to overcurrent.\nAccurate fault location. For example, when phase loss can occur, in addition to locating the phase of phase loss, it is also located to locate whether it is input phase loss or output phase loss. It is convenient for users to find the source of the fault on site.\nHas a record of downtime information. The record contains information such as input voltage, output voltage, current of each phase, shutdown source, and fault cause at the shutdown time. With such records, a standardized description of communication can be established between users and service providers. Avoid waste caused by poor information communication. When encountering difficult and complicated diseases such as on-site starting difficulties and inexplicable shutdown, calling the information of this specification is conducive to rapid communication and understanding of the on-site situation, which greatly facilitates the solution of faults and remote analysis and diagnosis. So that targeted measures can be taken to solve problems quickly.\nIn order to quickly and easily identify common faults on site, a “toolbox” is specially designed.

It is small and exquisite, and has a complete motor comprehensive protection function. The complete set of cabinets does not need an external protector, but it must be used with an external AC contactor. , After the soft starter is started, the AC contactor runs at full pressure, the product is more stable and reliable, and has a long service life.This product is widely used in the starting control of transmission equipment, fans, pumps, crushers and other loads, and the product complies with GB14048.6-2016\nPerformance characteristics： The soft starter design concept adheres to the principle of reliability, ease of use, practicality and low overall cost. The comprehensive cost mentioned here includes: manufacturing cost, on-site commissioning cost, fault diagnosis cost, after-sales service cost, etc. The specific features are listed below\nThe screen displays a large amount of information, which is convenient for remote diagnosis and analysis, and reduces the cost of fault resolution caused by miscalculation, including round-trip travel expenses\nExternally adapted N/5 current transformers, compared to N/1 or N/0.1 transformers, market versatility, convenient after-sales maintenance.\nThe thyristor driver circuit adopts pulse transformer to reduce the damage of the circuit board caused by poor conduction of thyristors.\nThere is no need to calibrate the current in the field. The V3 soft starter abandons the previous method of adapting the current sampling resistance to different power starter cabinets. The biggest disadvantage of the original method is that when matching different power cabinets, the current sensing resistance needs to be changed, and it often needs to be calibrated in the field. The V3 soft starter can be matched to the respective power cabinet only by means of a transformer ratio setting. Because of its versatility, it is greatly convenient for the whole machine factory stocking and on-site after-sales service personnel.\nThe trigger circuit is powerful and can be used with thyristors with trigger currents up to 100mA. Expand the adaptation range of thyristors, and also facilitate the selection of the whole machine factory.\nAll relays can be programmed for flexible response to user requirements.\nSet the starting and stopping methods of panel buttons and terminal blocks (jogging, soft starting, soft stop combinations) respectively, which can cope with some special requirements.\nA true two-wire approach. Two-wire control, start-stop mode wiring is extremely simple. In general, this start-stop method is especially suitable for float water supply applications.\nTwo starting methods: voltage start, current limit start.Voltage starting mode, similar to autocoupling starting or star-delta starting. However, it is especially suitable for occasions where the on-site power supply is relatively “soft”: the starting voltage output to the motor at starting is not affected by the input voltage, but only depends on the set starting voltage (except for the power supply voltage \u003c the starting voltage). It can reduce the unnecessary “slope climbing” time, reduce the high current heating time when the motor is started, and facilitate the rapid completion of the starting process;The current-limiting starting method is suitable for occasions where the starting current is relatively small on site. The average current of the three phases during the whole process of starting does not exceed the set value.\nTriac current limiting function. During the entire starting, running and soft-stop process, the current is monitored at any time not exceeding the nominal current of the thyristor. Minimize thyristor damage due to overcurrent.\nAccurate fault location. For example, when phase loss can occur, in addition to locating the phase of phase loss, it is also located to locate whether it is input phase loss or output phase loss. It is convenient for users to find the source of the fault on site.\nHas a record of downtime information. The record contains information such as input voltage, output voltage, current of each phase, shutdown source, and fault cause at the shutdown time. With such records, a standardized description of communication can be established between users and service providers. Avoid waste caused by poor information communication. When encountering difficult and complicated diseases such as on-site starting difficulties and inexplicable shutdown, calling the information of this specification is conducive to rapid communication and understanding of the on-site situation, which greatly facilitates the solution of faults and remote analysis and diagnosis. So that targeted measures can be taken to solve problems quickly.\nIn order to quickly and easily identify common faults on site, a “toolbox” is specially designed.

The V3 soft starter abandons the previous method of adapting the current sampling resistance to different power starter cabinets. The biggest disadvantage of the original method is that when matching different power cabinets, the current sensing resistance needs to be changed, and it often needs to be calibrated in the field.

In general, this start-stop method is especially suitable for float water supply applications.\nTwo starting methods: voltage start, current limit start.Voltage starting mode, similar to autocoupling starting or star-delta starting. However, it is especially suitable for occasions where the on-site power supply is relatively “soft”: the starting voltage output to the motor at starting is not affected by the input voltage, but only depends on the set starting voltage (except for the power supply voltage \u003c the starting voltage). It can reduce the unnecessary “slope climbing” time, reduce the high current heating time when the motor is started, and facilitate the rapid completion of the starting process;The current-limiting starting method is suitable for occasions where the starting current is relatively small on site. The average current of the three phases during the whole process of starting does not exceed the set value.\nTriac current limiting function. During the entire starting, running and soft-stop process, the current is monitored at any time not exceeding the nominal current of the thyristor.
