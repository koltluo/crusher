        &lt;h3&gt;Product Overview&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;product-overview&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#product-overview&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.senkuogroup.com/images/Complete-switch-cabinet/35.png&#34; alt=&#34;PK-series-microcomputer-protection-measurement-and-control-screen&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PK series microcomputer protection measurement and control panels are used in substation (distribution) substations with voltage levels of 35KV and below. Provide intelligent and networked measurement, protection and control functions for each high-voltage equipment in the station, and at the same time communicate with the upper master station in real time to realize the comprehensive automation of the substation (distribution) station. The main functions of this series of products include: various protection and measurement control of lines; various protection and measurement control of capacitors and motors; measurement and control functions such as bus section and incoming line backup automatic switching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Performance characteristics：&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;performance-characteristics&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#performance-characteristics&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It adopts ultra-high-speed dual 16-bit CPU system to work, with powerful functions: all measurement, control and protection units of this product use 80C196 chip launched by Intel Corporation, its speed is twice that of 8096, and the chip itself contains all peripheral circuits. Hardware design and its simplification, reasonable distribution of protection, control, measurement, communication and other functions to two CPU chips for processing, so as to ensure that tasks can be automatically switched when one of the CPUs fails, which greatly improves the processing capacity of the system. Make the system run more reliably and safely, and leave a lot of redundancy, which is beneficial to the user&amp;rsquo;s upgrade and expansion, and effectively prevents the system from working at full capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All COMS industrial-grade preferred chips, with extremely low power consumption for the entire screen: All integrated circuits of this product use industrial-grade COMS chips, which greatly reduces power consumption, and at the same time, the system noise tolerance is greatly improved, and the anti-interference ability is enhanced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Highly reliable design, anti-harsh environment, in line with IEC international standards: The professional design of this product is suitable for strong magnetic interference, components and connectors are reliable in contact, impact-resistant, and push-resistant. The temperature range of the working environment is wide, and the indicators of insulation, withstand voltage, impact, and anti-interference work are in line with IEC international standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The communication network is high-speed and reliable, and all devices on the network do not affect each other: this product uses a dedicated RS-485 network communication chip, which has strong fault tolerance and high reliability, and adopts photoelectric isolation, which fully guarantees the safety of all devices on the network. The interface itself also has a self-test system, which is convenient for the rapid maintenance of the company&amp;rsquo;s online faults. When a fault is detected in the communication port, it can be automatically isolated from the communication bus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
