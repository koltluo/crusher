    &lt;a href=&#34;#product-overview&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.senkuogroup.com/images/Complete-switch-cabinet/20.png&#34; alt=&#34;ZGS-12-intelligent-integrated-substation-American-style&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; /&gt;
ZGS-12 intelligent integrated substation American box substation is also called prefabricated substation or prefabricated substation. It is a kind of high-voltage switchgear, distribution transformer and low-voltage power distribution device. It is a factory prefabricated indoor and outdoor compact power distribution equipment arranged according to a certain wiring scheme, which is to organically combine functions such as transformer step-down and low-voltage power distribution. Together, they are installed in a moisture-proof, rust-proof, dust-proof, rodent-proof, fire-proof, theft-proof, heat-insulating, fully enclosed, and movable steel structure box. It is suitable for urban network construction and transformation, and is a rising trend after civil substations. Brand new substation. The box-type substation is suitable for mines, factories, enterprises, oil and gas fields, and wind power stations. It replaces the original civil engineering power distribution room and power distribution station, and becomes a new type of complete power transformation and distribution device. The box-type substation is suitable for residential quarters, urban public substations, bustling downtown, construction power supply, etc. Users can choose box-type substations according to different conditions of use and load levels. Since the box type substation came out, it has developed extremely rapidly. In developed countries in Europe, it has accounted for 70% of distribution transformers, and in the United States it has accounted for 90%. With the rapid development of China&amp;rsquo;s urban modernization and the continuous renewal and transformation of urban distribution networks, it will be widely used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Performance characteristics：&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;performance-characteristics&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#performance-characteristics&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The product is small in size and beautiful in appearance. Easy installation, operation and maintenance, reliable operation. The transformer adopts a three-phase five-column structure, and the winding connection group adopts Dyn11 connection, which has the characteristics of low loss, low noise, zero-sequence voltage self-suppression, three-phase voltage mutual non-interference, good lightning protection performance, and strong unbalanced load capacity. . The high-voltage side uses plug-in dual-sensitive fuses and backup fuses to provide double protection for the transformer. The shell is made of high-quality steel plate, which has good corrosion resistance after special anti-corrosion process. Shell protection grade IP33.&lt;/p&gt;
