        &lt;h3&gt;Product Overview&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;product-overview&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#product-overview&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.senkuogroup.com/images/Complete-switch-cabinet/24.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;HXGN17-12-unit-AC-metal-enclosed-ring-network-switchgear&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; /&gt;
HXGN17-12 box-type (fixed) metal-enclosed ring network switchgear (referred to as ring network cabinet) is a new type of high-voltage switchgear produced for the needs of urban power grid transformation and construction. In the power supply system, it is used to break the load current and close the short-circuit current. The ring network cabinet is equipped with a vacuum load switch, and the replacement mechanism is a spring operating mechanism, which can be operated manually or electrically. The switch and isolating knife are equipped with a dry-action operating mechanism. This ring network cabinet has a strong set-up, small size, no fire and explosion hazards, and has reliable &amp;ldquo;five-proof&amp;rdquo; functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Performance characteristics：&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;performance-characteristics&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#performance-characteristics&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The outside of the ring network cabinet is composed of a basic skeleton, a top plate, a panel, and a side plate to form a closed structure. The top of the ring network cabinet is the bus room, and the front of the bus room is the instrument room. The steel plates between the two rooms are separated. The upper part of the cabinet has a load switch room, and the middle and lower parts are cable entry and exit lines and other component rooms. The main equipment of the ring network cabinet It is composed of vacuum load switch, isolating switch (or isolating knife switch with fuse), earthing switch, lightning arrester, operating mechanism, interlocking mechanism and measurement and metering circuit, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Technical Parameters:&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;technical-parameters&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#technical-parameters&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ring network cabinet is mainly equipped with FZN21-1212/630 two-position vacuum load switch, and the main scheme is the inlet and outlet cabinets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incoming line cabinet scheme: a FZN21-12/630 two-position vacuum load switch is installed in the cabinet. The cabinet can also be flexibly equipped with CT and PT, and the main circuit is equipped with a FZN21-12630 vacuum load switch equipped with an isolation knife, which can respectively achieve connecting the busbar and isolating two stations&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outlet cabinet scheme: the cabinet is equipped with a FZ8N21-12/T125-1 5 load switch-fuse type combined electrical appliance, and CT, PT and ZnO lightning arresters, fuse combined electrical cabinets, and fuses can be flexibly assembled in the cabinet. The tube is equipped with a striker, and the striker strikes the tripping mechanism in case of a short circuit to realize quick disconnection and effectively protect electrical equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Five defenses&amp;rdquo; locking function:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;① Power transmission operation: Only when the cabinet door is closed and locked, and the grounding switch is operated to the &amp;ldquo;open&amp;rdquo; position, can the load switch be operated to the closing position&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;② Power-off operation: When the load switch is in the off position, the grounding switch can be closed, and when the grounding switch is in the closed position, the cabinet door can only be opened when the insulation board is in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;③ There is a reliable interlock between the vacuum fire chamber and the isolation knife, while the isolation knife and the grounding knife are interlocked with each other and interlocked with the cabinet door, and the insulation partition is also interlocked with the cabinet door&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;④Mechanical interlocking can also be realized between the two incoming cabinets, between the incoming cabinet and the outgoing cabinet.&lt;/p&gt;
