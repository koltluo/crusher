        &lt;h3&gt;Product Overview&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;product-overview&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#product-overview&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.senkuogroup.com/images/Complete-switch-cabinet/28.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;KYN28-12-armored-removable-AC-metal-enclosed-switchgear&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KYN28-12 type (GZS1) armored removable AC metal-enclosed switchgear (hereinafter referred to as switchgear) is a three-phase AC 50Hz indoor complete power distribution device, used to receive and non-distribute 3-12KV network power and The circuit implements control protection and supervision. Various types of microcomputer integrated relay protection devices are installed on the panel of the relay chamber of this product, and can realize the intelligent control of the system. It has the functions of remote control, telemetry, remote signaling and remote adjustment, and is controlled by CAN bus with communication interface. The on-site network also has the functions of preventing misoperation of circuit breakers, preventing pulling back of the handcart with load, preventing grounding switch from being closed with a point, preventing the grounding switch from transmitting power at the grounding position and preventing accidental entry into the charged interval, namely the &amp;ldquo;five prevention&amp;rdquo; functions for short.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cabinet can be equipped with VSI (ZN63), ZN12V vacuum circuit breaker, imported VD4 vacuum circuit breaker and VC series vacuum contactor.&lt;/p&gt;

It has strong anti-corrosion and anti-oxidation effects, and has higher mechanical strength than the same steel plate. The switch cabinet is divided into handcart room (circuit breaker compartment), busbar room, cable room, relay instrument room (low voltage room) by partitions. Each unit case is independently grounded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cabinet shell and partitions of the switchgear are made of aluminum-zinc-coated steel plates or steel plates processed by CNC machine tools and then bolted after bending, so the assembled switchgear can maintain the uniformity in size. Aluminum-zinc clad steel plate has strong anti-corrosion and anti-oxidation effects, and has higher mechanical strength than the same steel plate. The switchgear is divided into handcart room, busbar room, cable room and relay instrument room by the partition, and the shell of each unit has independent grounding. The parts of the switchgear are all electrostatically sprayed to make the surface have the advantages of anti-collision, corrosion resistance, beautiful appearance (the color can be customized by the user), etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monthly average relative humidity: ≤90%; monthly average water vapor pressure does not exceed 1.8KPa;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;◆Altitude: below 1000m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;◆Earthquake intensity: no more than 8℃.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;◆The surrounding air should be free from obvious pollution such as corrosive or combustible gas and water vapor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;◆No place with severe vibration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;◆When it is used under the normal conditions specified in GB3906, the user shall negotiate with the company.&lt;/p&gt;
