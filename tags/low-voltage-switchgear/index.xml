        &lt;h3&gt;Product Overview&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;product-overview&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#product-overview&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.senkuogroup.com/images/Complete-switch-cabinet/35.png&#34; alt=&#34;PK-series-microcomputer-protection-measurement-and-control-screen&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PK series microcomputer protection measurement and control panels are used in substation (distribution) substations with voltage levels of 35KV and below. Provide intelligent and networked measurement, protection and control functions for each high-voltage equipment in the station, and at the same time communicate with the upper master station in real time to realize the comprehensive automation of the substation (distribution) station. The main functions of this series of products include: various protection and measurement control of lines; various protection and measurement control of capacitors and motors; measurement and control functions such as bus section and incoming line backup automatic switching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Performance characteristics：&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;performance-characteristics&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#performance-characteristics&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It adopts ultra-high-speed dual 16-bit CPU system to work, with powerful functions: all measurement, control and protection units of this product use 80C196 chip launched by Intel Corporation, its speed is twice that of 8096, and the chip itself contains all peripheral circuits. Hardware design and its simplification, reasonable distribution of protection, control, measurement, communication and other functions to two CPU chips for processing, so as to ensure that tasks can be automatically switched when one of the CPUs fails, which greatly improves the processing capacity of the system. Make the system run more reliably and safely, and leave a lot of redundancy, which is beneficial to the user&amp;rsquo;s upgrade and expansion, and effectively prevents the system from working at full capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All COMS industrial-grade preferred chips, with extremely low power consumption for the entire screen: All integrated circuits of this product use industrial-grade COMS chips, which greatly reduces power consumption, and at the same time, the system noise tolerance is greatly improved, and the anti-interference ability is enhanced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Highly reliable design, anti-harsh environment, in line with IEC international standards: The professional design of this product is suitable for strong magnetic interference, components and connectors are reliable in contact, impact-resistant, and push-resistant. The temperature range of the working environment is wide, and the indicators of insulation, withstand voltage, impact, and anti-interference work are in line with IEC international standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The communication network is high-speed and reliable, and all devices on the network do not affect each other: this product uses a dedicated RS-485 network communication chip, which has strong fault tolerance and high reliability, and adopts photoelectric isolation, which fully guarantees the safety of all devices on the network. The interface itself also has a self-test system, which is convenient for the rapid maintenance of the company&amp;rsquo;s online faults. When a fault is detected in the communication port, it can be automatically isolated from the communication bus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

        &lt;h3&gt;Product Overview&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;product-overview&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#product-overview&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.senkuogroup.com/images/Complete-switch-cabinet/38.png&#34; alt=&#34;GCS-type-low-voltage-withdrawable-complete-switchgear&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; /&gt;
GCS series combined low-voltage switchgear (hereinafter referred to as GCS complete switchgear). It is suitable for the power system of AC 50~60HZ, rated working voltage AC 380V, rated insulation voltage 660V, 1600KVA and below distribution transformer as power distribution, power, lighting, reactive power compensation, motor control center, and designed in the standard cabinet The mixed system of fixed scheme and withdrawal scheme can meet the different needs of users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Performance characteristics：&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;performance-characteristics&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#performance-characteristics&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The basic frame of the switchgear is a combined assembly structure, all of which are fastened and connected by screws, plus doors, partitions, brackets, busbars, drawers and electrical components to form a complete switchgear with the following characteristics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The overall size of the frame and parts and the size of the opening are changed according to the modulus E = 20mm;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since all structural parts of the frame are fastened and connected by screws, welding deformation and stress are avoided, precision is improved, versatility is strong, applicability is good, and it has high mechanical strength, which fully meets the requirements of the switch cabinet. various performance requirements and changes;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the MCC scheme, the interior of the switchgear is divided into three areas (rooms), the busbar area, the electrical equipment area and the cable area, and the three areas are separated by steel plates to ensure the normal operation of the line and effectively prevent the expansion of faults. When the drawer is pulled out of the cabinet, the charged body in the cabinet is not exposed, which is safe and reliable;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the PC scheme, the manual mechanisms of AH and ME circuit breakers protrude out of the door. When operating by hand, there is no need to open the door panel, which is safe and convenient;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the fixed scheme, it not only retains the characteristics of simplicity, practicality and low price of the fixed scheme, but also has the same appearance as a chest of drawers. Its interior is also divided into busbar area, electrical equipment area and cable area. The three areas are also equally It is safe and reliable to separate with steel plate or insulation board, and it is an ideal equipment to replace the old domestic fixed products;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drawers of the MCC cabinet have four standard sizes, which are 200, 300, 400, and 600 respectively. They are light in structure, easy to assemble, and high in dimensional accuracy. The four standard sizes can be changed according to the design and user requirements. The drawer unit has Good interchangeability, and there are working position and separation position, the handle can be locked by padlock, and it is in the specified disconnection position;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The switchgear is designed for two power supply and consumption types of three-phase four-wire and three-phase five-wire power distribution system. The neutral bus N line and the protective grounding bus PE line are installed on the bottom of the cabinet, and the outlet end is used Busbar connection makes it very convenient for users to connect cables;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to ensure the reliable continuity of grounding, all common parts such as drawer rails in the cabinet are galvanized;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A natural ventilation net cover is provided on the top of the switchgear without reducing the protection level of the enclosure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, the switchgear adopts the structure imitating foreign advanced cabinets, with high mechanical strength and high degree of standardization. It conforms to the IEC439 international standard and GB7251 national standard as a whole. Its protection level conforms to IP3X in GB4208 and is equivalent to IP30 in IEC529.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
