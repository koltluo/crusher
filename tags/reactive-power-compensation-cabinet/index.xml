    &lt;a href=&#34;#product-overview&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.senkuogroup.com/images/Complete-switch-cabinet/7.png&#34; alt=&#34;TBB-10-High-Voltage-Reactive-Power-Automatic-Compensation-Device&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; /&gt;
TBB□-10 high-voltage reactive power automatic compensation device is suitable for reactive power automatic tracking compensation of 35kV, 10kV (6kV) buses in 220kV, 110kV, 35kV substations, and is mainly used in 3-35kV three-phase power frequency AC power systems with large load fluctuations , the use of centralized compensation still cannot meet the system requirements, often resulting in over-compensation or under-compensation. This device can detect the reactive power required by the system in real time, and then compare it with the set value to perform automatic intelligent switching operation, so that the reactive power of the system can reach a dynamic balance, so as to improve the power factor of the system and stabilize the system Voltage, reduce loss and save electricity cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has alarm protection functions such as high voltage, low voltage, PT disconnection, structural failure, and main transformer overcurrent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equipped with RS-485 or RS-232 high-speed data communication interface, it can realize the &amp;ldquo;four remote&amp;rdquo; function by cooperating with the integrated automation system of the main substation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The high-voltage vacuum switch dedicated to modular capacitors is used, and five sets are installed in one side of the ordinary switch cabinet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can be flexibly grouped according to the total compensation capacity, and can be divided into 6 groups with different capacities at most, and the maximum capacity of each group is 2000Kvar/5000Kvar, and it can be switched automatically according to the combination of reactive power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equipped with ZSBH capacitor bank microcomputer protection device can realize two-stage overcurrent and zero-sequence voltage protection functions. When a failure occurs in a certain group, Ke will automatically cut off and block, without affecting the normal switching of other capacitor groups.&lt;/p&gt;
