        &lt;h3&gt;Product Overview&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;product-overview&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#product-overview&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.senkuogroup.com/images/Complete-switch-cabinet/19.png&#34; alt=&#34;YB33-wind-power-box-type-substation&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; /&gt;
It is widely used in cable distribution in 40.5KV (17.5KV, 24KV, 35KV) power systems, cable distribution boxes and transition boxes in wind farm projects. Its connection method is simple, flexible, convenient, safe and reliable. The cabinet body is made of 2 mm stainless steel plate, which is strong and durable. The live part is fully insulated and fully sealed. This product is widely used in urban industrial districts, residential districts, commercial centers, mining areas, large enterprises such as steel, automobile, petroleum, chemical industry, cement and other occasions in the distribution network, especially suitable for urban power grid reconstruction projects, which can greatly save electrical equipment and Cable investment to improve power supply reliability. FKRN-40.5/630 high-voltage load switch is attached to the cable distribution box, and the melt current specification (A) of the high-voltage current-limiting fuse: 6.3, 10, 16, 20, 25, 31.5, 40, 50, 63.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Performance characteristics：&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;performance-characteristics&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#performance-characteristics&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The box substation integrates high and low voltage primary equipment, transformers, and secondary equipment in a double-layer, sealed, anti-corrosion, and movable outdoor box in the factory. Box-type substation, also known as prefabricated substation or prefabricated substation. It is a kind of high-voltage switchgear, distribution transformer and low-voltage power distribution device. It is a factory prefabricated indoor and outdoor compact power distribution device arranged according to a certain wiring scheme, which is to organically combine functions such as transformer step-down and low-voltage power distribution. Together, they are installed in a moisture-proof, rust-proof, dust-proof, rodent-proof, fire-proof, theft-proof, heat-insulated, fully enclosed, and movable steel structure box, which is especially suitable for urban network construction and transformation. A brand new substation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The box-type substation is suitable for mines, factories, enterprises, oil and gas fields, and wind power stations. It replaces the original civil engineering power distribution room and power distribution station, and becomes a new type of complete power transformation and distribution device. The overall structure of the box transformer is mainly divided into three parts: high-voltage switchgear, transformer and low-voltage power distribution device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The front part is the wiring cabinet, which includes high and low voltage terminals, high voltage load switch, plug-in fuse, high voltage tap changer operating handle, oil level gauge, oil temperature gauge, etc.; the rear part is the oil tank body, heat sink, transformer winding , iron core, high voltage load switch and plug-in fuse are all in the oil tank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The box adopts a fully sealed structure. The integrated box change has been developed by domestic manufacturers recently, and it is not widely used. It is a double-layer structure. European, American, and integrated box changes have their own advantages and disadvantages. In a large shell, the heat dissipation condition is poor, and a mechanical exhaust device is required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American-style box-type transformers have relatively good heat dissipation conditions because the transformer cooling fins directly dissipate heat to the outside. The integrated box-type substation occupies less land, and its advantages and disadvantages are similar to those of the American-style box-type substation. In addition, American-style and integrated transformers can only be manufactured in China with a capacity of less than 630kVA, while European-style transformers can reach 1250kVA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are no less than 2 copper grounding terminals connected to the grounding grid on the grounding conductor of the YB33 wind power box-type substation, and the electrical contact area is not less than 160mm2. The grounding conductor is a copper conductor, and when the rated short-circuit duration is 1s, its current density does not exceed 200A/mm2; when the rated short-circuit duration is 2s, its current density does not exceed 140A/mm2; when the rated short-circuit duration is 3s , its current density does not exceed 125A/mm2; when the rated short-circuit duration is 4s, its current density does not exceed 110A/mm2, and its minimum cross-section is not less than 30mm2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Components connected to the grounding conductor include: box-type substation shell (metal part), switchgear frame or shell (metal part), grounding conductor and metal shielding of cables, metal frame of transformer, grounding conductor of control and protection devices, etc. A sufficient number of grounding terminals are installed on the grounding conductor, and the grounding terminals are made of copper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
